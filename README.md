# Python 3 Slideshow Software
The problem with any presentation software such as PowerPoint, iWork Keynote or LibreOffice Impress is that they present in full-screen, which isn't the best option when you are doing live screen sharing and using other apps at the same time. This slideshow app, written in Python 3.8 will help you out in such a case.
## Support
This project currently supports linux based platforms, including macOS. The files are supposed to run on windows as well, but hasn't been tested yet.

## Troubleshooting

If the image turns out to be too large, reduce it's size in your preferred image editor and start the slideshow again!
